                 <br>This page explores the distribution of foreign population in Shanghai International Settlement in 1930. The year 1930 was a relatively calm period for the two settlements: no major warfare or pollical events disrupted the lives of foreigners residing here. From the perspective of historical change, the story in this page only presents a very limited view of the demographic landscape of SIS during a particular, and by no means representative, moment in history. 
<br><br>The first data visualization and the maps aim to present some background information of SIS. As shown here, SIS was divided into four major administrative districts (Eastern, Western, Central, Northern), which were further divided into eleven police districts (hereafter PD). In the processing stage of this project, I decided to use police districts as my unit of analysis, because I thought they would present a more detailed and nuanced picture of population distribution within SIS. 	
<br><br>In the first graph, the size of the rectangle represents the size of the PD, whereas the color represents the total population—both Chinese and foreigners included—of the PD. I chose to represent total population as opposed to foreign population in the first graph, because the viewer could then compare the two graphs (the second containing data on foreign population in each PD) and therefore get a vague sense of the larger demographic environment within which foreigners lived: although governed by foreigners, SIS was still predominantly occupied by Chinese residents across all PDs. 
<br><br>The second graph, which shows the population of each nationality in each PD, is the central component of this section. Unlike the diachronic line chart in the previous two sections where most significant changes can be explained by coeval historical events, it is impossible to give sufficient accounts on every detail in this synchronic distribution graph—the question of how and why populations were spatially distributed in particular manner would require much more research than the scope of this project allows. Here, I provide a very limited reading of the graph.   
<br><br>What stands out most is perhaps the surprisingly large population of Japanese in Hongkew. Historians of Shanghai have identified the existence of a “Little Tokyo” in Hongkew, where large numbers of Japanese people settled in since 1900s. They opened their own grocery stores, restaurants, brothels, and built Japanese-style residence. It is not clear what made Hongkew such a popular place of residence for Japanese. Other than Hongkew, the presence of large Japanese factories in Yangtszepoo, Gorden, and Pootoo explains the relative abundance of Japanese population in these three districts. People there might want to live close to their work place. 
<br><br>There were few French residents in the entire SIS. This makes perfect sense, since the vast majority of French population in Shanghai lived in SFC, where various entertainment and social venues ranging from cabaret dancing halls to outdoor parks were built to create a comfortable and enjoyable enclave for the French residents. 
<br><br>Quite a few British lived in Central district, perhaps because it was where the Shanghai Municipal Council was located. (British had the most seats in SMC and also headed all the Municipal departments until Japanese occupation). Sinza and Bubbling Well were the two more upscale places where most business was conducted and living was more expensive; considerable British presence in these two districts perhaps also speak to the prominence of British influence in the foreign community in Shanghai.
<br><br>More comprehensive knowledge about the spatial and demographic feature of Shanghai and its broader socio-economic history are needed to further contextualize the data presented here and to utilize them for historical analysis, as there are still more questions can be asked from these two graphs. &nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
