                    <br>Population Change, 1865-1936</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br><br>This section traces the diachronic population change of International Settlement (SIS) and French Concession (SFC). This page contains two line charts that show population change of six nationalities in the two settlements. The next page contains two interactive maps that compare data between 1936 and 1942. <br><br>Let’s look at these two line charts here. It should be noticed that in both graphs, the “Population” axis is not evenly scaled, and I designed it this way on purpose: the difference among nationalities is sometimes too great that an evenly scaled comparison would render the visualization messy and uninformative, especially in places where multiple lines overlap one another. The downside of this decision, then, is that the one has to view the graph counter-intuitively. For example, a seemingly drastic increase in the lower stratum is actually a far smaller change than an unimpressive increment in the higher stratum. Therefore, when making comparison across dots and lines, it is important to be aware of this visual trap.  <br><br>Now we can begin our analysis of the visualizations. My overall argument in this section is that patterns of population change generally reflect how significant domestic (that is, Chinese) and international events impacted foreigners in Shanghai. While there’s no information from pre-1865, the general decrease in foreign population from 1865-1870 might be caused by a trauma many foreign residents experienced during and after the Taiping Rebellion, a more than decade-long regional rebellion that wreaked havoc on most of eastern China. The gradual climbing of Japanese population immediately after 1895 in the International Settlement was largely the result of Treaty of Shimonoseki, which concluded the First Sino-Japanese War and opened up ample opportunities for aspiring Japanese businessmen and workers who immigrated to Shanghai. Japan’s victory in the Russo-Japanese War (190-05) brought more Japanese investment to Shanghai, thus contributing further to the population rise. As the number Japanese population steadily increased all the way up to the 1940s, the vast majority resided in SIS. SFC, by contrast, never had too many Japanese residents. <br><br>The effect of the First World War on the settlements wasn’t as tremendous as I previously assumed. German population witnessed sharp decline in both SIS and SFC. This was because Germans left en masse during and after the war, as other Westerners in Shanghai at the time—French, British, and Americans—came to regard Germans as enemies and isolated German community from lives in the settlements. In late 1918, the triumphant British and French decided to expel all the Germans from the settlements. All the other nationalities saw varying degrees of increase from 1915-1920. Most remarkable among them is the Russian, which can be explained by the outbreak of Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The degree of Russian population increase was even more noticeable from 1920-1925, when the Russian Civil War caused hundreds and thousands of Russians to fled to China and settle in big cities like Shanghai. (Unlike most other foreigners, the majority of Russians who came to Shanghai during the late 1910s and 1920s were refugees. Technically, the term “nationality” would not apply to them after 1921, when the Soviet government deprived all persons who remained outside Russia of Russian citizenship) German community also returned to its pre-war vibrancy since 1921, the year when China and Weimer Republic returned to friendly terms. Perhaps the only thing I still can’t explain during this period is the prominent increase of Americans in both settlements from 1915-20. <br><br>Sometimes historical events don’t offer good explanation for the patterns I found here. For example, one would expect Russian population swelling again in both settlements from 1930-35, because Japan’s occupation of Manchuria (Northeastern China) in 1932, a region with a large Russian population, forced many Russians to move southward to lower-Yangtze area including Shanghai. However, one finds only partial evidence of this migration in the increase of Russian population in SFC, but in SIS there is actually a slight decrease from 1930-35. <br><br>These two graphs leave many other questions that I am not able to address at the moment. For example, why were most Russians going to SFC, instead of SIS, since the 1930s, especially given that there were actually more Russian population in SIS prior to that? And why were there such a big difference on Japanese population between the two settlements?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
