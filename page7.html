                    <br>Population Change, 1935-1942</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>This page takes on the same topic of diachronic population change using another data visualization technique—interactive map. The first map shows foreign population in SIS in 1935 and 1942, and the second shows foreign population in SFC in 1936 and 1942. The viewer can move (hold the “shift” key while dragging the mouse), zoom in, and zoom out the map, and also uses the upper-right corner bar to select which year they want to look at. The orange dots represent the size of population of this nationality in the given settlement in the given year; the bigger the dot, the bigger the population. 
<br>
<br>I designed these two visualizations as an attempt to answer a historical question: how did the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and the Second World War (which the Second Sino-Japanese War was considered as a part of) affect the overall population landscape in the two settlements? As an independent government, SIS had de facto ceased to exist after December 1941 (see Timeline), while SFC continued to exist under Vichy France (1940-44) until 1943, when the territory was given back to the Wang Jingwei government, a puppet regime backed by Japan. A comparison between the year 1935 and 1942 for SIS and between 1936 and 1942 for SFC might tell us a little about the effect of the two wars. 
<br>
<br>The two maps are able to provide some answers to my question. It is clear that both settlements experienced noticeable, if not tremendous increase in Japanese population, which makes perfect sense as Japan had occupied much of Shanghai since 1937. The signing of the Tripartite Pact by Germany, Japan, and Italy in September 1940 signaled the formal alliance of the Axis Powers, so it would make sense to see significant rise of German population in both settlements. British and American populations plummeted, as the two countries were in hostile terms with the Japanese. Those who left earlier were lucky: when Japanese force occupied SIS in 1942, thousands of British and Americans were sent to concentration camps built by Japanese military around Shanghai. The prisoners lived miserably for almost three years. The French population, however, remained roughly the same in both settlements. 
<br>
<br>Given what’s available, this is all we can know from these two maps. If one wants to explore beyond the question posed above and dig deeper into the archive, one might make new observations and draw further conclusions. For example, another interesting question would be whether and how Japanese occupation effected the lives of other foreigners in the settlements. Considering the fact that Japanese population had ready been a strong presence for decades, it would be interesting to see how the new face of such presence—now militarized and imperialized—impacted the everyday life of the occupied. &nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
